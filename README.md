<h1 align="center">Twitter Sentiment Analysis</h1>
### Introduction
This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify tweets based on sentiment.
By analyzing the text of tweets, we can identify patterns that help us predict the sentiment of future tweets.
With this information, we can help businesses and individuals better understand how their brand or product is perceived on social media. 
Whether you're a marketer looking to improve your brand reputation or an individual looking to better understand your online presence, 
our project can help you achieve your goals. Here I have used Natural Language Toolkit for Data Preprocessing and DecisionTreeClassifier for making predicions.
I have achieved 79.78% accuracy.
